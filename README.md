# Project: Classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game #

This project implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. <br>

*The HTML file contains elements for:*
- *displaying the game's title,*
- *buttons for the player to choose their move (rock, paper, or scissors),* 
- *a section to display the game result and moves, and*
- *a score section.* <br>
---

*The CSS file styles:*
- *the background,*
- *text, buttons, and
- other elements for a visually appealing layout.*

*The JavaScript code handles the game logic:*
- *including generating a random move for the computer*,
- *determining the winner or if it's a tie,*
- *updating the score, and*
- *displaying the result and moves on the webpage.*

*It also includes a function to reset the score when the corresponding button is clicked. <br>
The game uses localStorage to store and retrieve the player's score across sessions, ensuring continuity between game plays.*
